# Create an NFS Export

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll use the QF2 dashboard to create a Network File System (NFS) export. The export allows NFS clients to share data stored in a particular directory.

1. Log in as admin if you need to.
2. The dashboard appears.
3. Point to **Sharing** and then click **NFS Exports** from the drop-down list.

7. You must fill in all the required fields. Here are the definitions:

* **File system path**. The path to the directory to be exported.
* **Create new directory with inherited permissions**. If selected, creates a new directory if the file system path does not exist.
* **Export path**. The NFS export name that will be mounted by clients.
* **Description**. A description of  the export (optional field).
* **Allowed IPs**. A list of IP addresses that the export can be restricted to. The default is to allow all IP addresses access to the export (optional). 
* **User mapping**. Forces user IDs to be mapped to a specific ID. The **No mapping** option is the default.
* **Read-only**. By default, the export is read-writeable. If you select **Yes**, it is only readable.

>Here is an example. The directory test2 will be created on the file system and exported as test2. There is no user mapping and the export will be read-writeable. There are no IP access restrictions.
